# B-Em

Introduction
============

B-em is an attempt to emulate a BBC Micro, made by Acorn Computers in the 80s.
It is presently available for Win32 and Linux/UNIX.

B-em is licensed under the GPL, see COPYING for more details.

TODO File
=========

A [TODO.md](TODO.md) file exists, with ideas for future functionality for
future versions of B-em.

Contact
=======

B-em is maintained by a group of volunteers -- please [enquire over on the
stardot forums](http://www.stardot.org.uk/forums) for more details.

# Compiling
## Linux

You will need the following libraries:

* Allegro 4.x
* OpenAL
* ALut
* Zlib

### Released version

Open a terminal window, navigate to the B-em directory then enter:

./configure
make && ./b-em

### From Git Sources

```
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
```

### Notes

* The menu is not available all the time. Press F11 to open it, then F11 to
  close again.
* The debugger is only available via the command line.
* Hardware line doubling mode and the PAL filters are not available on Linux.
* Fullscreen mode doesn't appear to work correctly, at least on my machine.
  B-em takes over the screen, but the resolution never changes.
* Video performance is noticeably slower than on Windows. This is largely due
  to the lack of hardware acceleration support in B-em.
* Mouse capture is not available. Simply because I don't know how to implement
  it on Linux.

Command Line Options
====================

```
b-em [discimage.ssd/dsd/adf/adl/fdi] [-u name.uef] [-mx] [-tx] [-i] [-c] [-fx]
```

`-u` name.uef - load UEF image name.uef

`-mx` - model to emulate, where x is

```
0 - BBC A with OS 0.1
1 - BBC B with OS 0.1
2 - BBC A
3 - BBC B with 8271 FDC
4 - BBC B with 8271 FDC + loads of sideways RAM

`-fx` - set frameskip to x (1-9, 1=no skip)

`-fasttape` - speeds up tape access


IDE Hard Discs
==============

To initialise a hard disc, use the included HDINIT program. Press 'I' to investigate the drive - this will
set up the default parameters for a 50 mb drive. If you want a different size press 'Z' and enter the desired
size - it does not matter that this does not match the size given in the emulated hardware.

Then press 'F' to format, and follow the prompts.


Master 512
==========

Master 512 includes mouse emulation. This is used by trapping the mouse in the emulator window - click in the
window to capture it, and press CTRL + END to release.

All disc images used by the Master 512 should have the .img extension - the type is determined by size. Both
640k and 800k discs are supported, as well as DOS standard 360k and 720k.

You can use the IDE hard disc emulation with this, run HDISK.CMD in DOS-Plus, then HDINSTAL.BAT. Go make a cup 
of tea while doing this, it takes _forever_! HDISK.CMD will create a file 'DRIVE_C' in ADFS so you will need 
to format the hard disc using ADFS first.


65816 coprocessor
=================

The ROMs for this coprocessor are not included with the emulator. You will need to acquire the file 
ReCo6502ROM_816 and place it in roms\tube.

The 65816 runs at 16mhz, regardless of what the firmware is set to.


Hardware emulated
=================

| Processor | Meaning |
| --------- | ------- |
| The 6502 processor | All instructions should be emulated. Attempts to be cycle perfect. 65C02 is emulated for 
  		       Master 128 mode. |
| The 65C12 tube    | As a parasite processor.|
| The 65816 tube    | As a parasite processor. Emulator from Snem. |
| The Z80 tube      | As a parasite processor. Probably a few bugs. Emulator from ZX82. |
| The ARM processor | As a parasite processor for Master 128 only. Emulator from Arculator. |
| The 80186 tube    | As a parasite processor for Master 512 only. Emulator from PCem. |
| The 6845 CRTC     | Cycle-exact emulation. Runs everything I've tried, with all effects working. |
| The Video ULA     | Cycle-exact emulation, though I think palette changes are a cycle off? Might be a delay in the real chip. |
| The System VIA    | Keyboard and sound emulated. Also CMOS on Master-based models.|
| The User VIA      | Emulated.
| 8271 FDC          | Double disc, double sided, 40/80 tracks, read/write. With authentic noise. Supports read-only access of protected FDI images.|
| 1770 FDC          | Double disc, double sided, 40/80 tracks, read/write. With authentic noise. Supports read-only access of protected FDI images.|
| IDE hard disc	    | Emulates 2 discs. Emulation from Arculator.|
| Sound             | All channels emulated, with sample support and some undocumented behaviour (Crazee Rider).  With optional bandpass filter.|
| BeebSID |  Emulated using resid-fp, so should be pretty accurate. Is only emulated when accessed, to reduce CPU load.|
| ADC               | Real joystick emulation, supporting both joysticks.|
| 6850 ACIA         | Emulated for cassettes. Read only.|
| Serial ULA        | Emulated.|


Hardware NOT emulated
=====================

* Serial Port
* Econet
* Printer
* 32016 processor - though it can be enabled in the source.
  (Doesn't actually run anything useful though).
